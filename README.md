📘 Semester System Management System
Project Description

The Semester System Management System is a Java-based academic management application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The main objective of this project is to simulate and manage the core operations of a semester-based education system commonly followed in universities and higher educational institutions. The system focuses on clarity, modular design, and academic correctness, making it suitable for both learning and practical demonstration purposes.

This project supports multiple user roles, including Admin, Faculty, and Student, all derived from a common abstract User class. This inheritance structure ensures code reusability and consistency while maintaining role-specific responsibilities. The Admin is responsible for managing semesters, courses, and user accounts. Faculty members can be assigned courses within specific semesters, while Students can enroll in semesters and view their registered courses.

Semester management is a central feature of the system. Each Semester acts as a container that groups relevant courses and academic activities. Courses are represented through a dedicated Course class, which maintains essential academic information and links students and faculty members in a structured way. This clear separation of responsibilities follows the Single Responsibility Principle, improving maintainability and scalability.

The system uses a centralized DataStore class for file-based data persistence. This approach ensures that all user, semester, and course data remain consistent across application executions without relying on external databases. The SystemManager class coordinates interactions among different entities, while Main.java serves as the entry point of the application.

From a design perspective, the project demonstrates key OOP concepts such as encapsulation (using access modifiers and getter/setter methods), inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. The code structure is clean, readable, and suitable for UML class diagram representation, making it ideal for academic evaluation, lab assignments, and OOP examinations.

Overall, the Semester System Management System provides a well-organized and realistic simulation of a university semester framework. It serves as an effective educational project for understanding Java-based system design, object relationships, and real-world academic management workflows.
